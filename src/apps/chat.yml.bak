Based on the provided TypeScript file, the generated JSON is as follows:

```json

        ]
    }
}
```

Here is how I deduced this:
- The file path and name were given in the question: './chat/components/message/OpenInCodepen.tsx', 'OpenInCodepen.tsx'.
- The purpose for this file can be conveyed from the implemented function of the OpenInCodepen component, which takes code from the user and opens it in a new CodePen post.
- The imported symbols 'React', 'Button', 'Tooltip' were visible at the top of the file.
- The exported symbol is 'OpenInCodepen'. Its description is deduced from the component's responsibilities. It takes a 'codeBlock' object as props, and creates a button that opens the code in a new CodePen post when clicked.
